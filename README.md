# handwritten_digit_recognition
This project is a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It was built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a convolutional neural network architecture. The model has an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

### Overview
This project is a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a convolutional neural network architecture.

### Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
OpenCV
PIL

Once you have the libraries installed, you can open this Jupyter notebook and run the Python script. You will need to provide the path to the training and test sets of MNIST images in the script. Once you have trained the model, you can use it to predict the new digit by running the last code cell in the script and providing the path to the new image.

### Results
The model has an accuracy of 98% on the test set. A confusion matrix and classification report are included in the results directory.
